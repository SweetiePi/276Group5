## Origins and Inspiration

Many university students face common experience: lack of shared social and collaboration online hubs tailored to their needs.

As university students ourselves, we feel this deeply in our everyday lives.

Institutional services exist, but do not provide a realtime experience of interaction and often limit customization.

Most crucially, we focus on the **chat and social element**. No other service gives quite the feel of being to chat and work together with fellow students and instructors in realtime.

When posed with the question of a topic for a course group project, this came to mind immediately. We could put our skills to use in fixing this problem in a way only students can understand. That is how StuHub can to

## Primary features

At StuHub, we focus on being a **Course Hub**.

Primary features lay in the realtime chat, online study groups, and schedule and file sharing:

* **Realtime Chat:** Instantly send and receive messages from other students in your courses and groups, a vast improvement over traditional post-style conversations.
* **Study Groups:** Create study groups and arrange gatherings for an upcoming examination or just to discuss what you missed in lecture. Find out who else is in the courses you are taking.
* **Schedule Sharing:** No more sending screenshots or lists of your courses. Make a visualization of your term schedule public to share with your friends and whoever else you want. Your courses can be automatically shown on the schedule by simply adding your courses and selecting the appropriate sections. Even custom events can be shown.
* **File Sharing:** Quickly upload files and documents to share in posts and messages. We integrate with Dropbox so any files there can be shared too.

Many other features exist as well, browse through the help guide for more.
