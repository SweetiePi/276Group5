<% provide(:email_title, 'Account Email Change for ' + @user.email) %>

Someone requested an email change from <%= @user.email %> to <%= @user.email_change_new %>

Use the following link within the next two hours to complete the change:

<%= edit_email_change_url(@user.email_change_token, email: @user.email) %>

If you did not request this email change, please immediately go to your
account settings and change your password:

<%= edit_user_url(@user) %>

You should also verify that other accounts which may use the same email
address and/or password have not been compromised.
